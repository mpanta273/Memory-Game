## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

// took references from these websites in order to understand the keywords and syntax

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
  
  Using any of the code given in the prework, I tried to write it on my own. Everything seemed alright at first but I struggled while incorporating the tones in the button. I felt the pre-work lacked certain explanations related to it. So, I went over a few resources on the web and looked it up. I understood the code in the pre work and was comfortable using it in my work. After working on it, though I did not get enough time using it in prework, I have been tinkering with it in individual lines of code outside of this project and it seems really interesting how we can use this in a variety of other ways rather than just pressing the button with moving texts and stuff.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I recently took a class on databases. I found it really interesting and got to know its real world uses in web development. After this project, I want to learn ways of integrating my knowledge of databases to back end web development. 

I want to learn about the process of hosting our web pages on the internet. How big companies and websites manage to operate web pages with very high numbers of users daily.

I want to know about the careers in the field of web development like the types of positions open for internships in tech companies and work life as a web developer. 

 
4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
  
  I would add scores for each player taking in account their total time taken to solve the game and number of mistakes. To calculate the time I would first try to implement the sixth optional feature as mentioned in the prework. adding the clock at the start of the game and calculating total time taken and the number of mistakes. Also, I could store the results in a database and display the leaderboards at the end.  Another thing that I would love to add is to make the buttons move when we click it, An animated button of sorts in order to make it look more interactive.
